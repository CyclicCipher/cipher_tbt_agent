# Transformers — sample-efficient skill acquisition

## Transformer × linear regression (2026-07-27) — `linreg.py`

**Question asked:** can a transformer, trained with AdamW + LR scheduling, learn a linear regression?
**Answer: yes — and the scheduling is not what makes it work.** ~35 s per arm on the 3050 Ti; `python
experiments/transformers/linreg.py`.

The question has two readings and they are different experiments, so both are run. MEMORISE = one `w` for the whole
dataset (fit a single linear map; any model does this). IN-CONTEXT = a FRESH `w` per sequence, never shown — the prompt is
`x1 y1 x2 y2 … xk` and `w` cannot be memorised, so the only way to succeed is to run the regression IN THE FORWARD PASS
(Garg et al. 2022, arXiv:2208.01066). Setup: d=8, k=20, 4 layers × 64 dim, 3000 steps, batch 64, noiseless.

**The measurement is the loss against k, not a final number** — a model that learned the task shows loss FALLING as
evidence accumulates; a model that learned only the marginal shows a FLAT curve at Var(y). A single loss cannot tell those
apart. Baselines: predict-zero (normalised MSE 1.0 by construction) and RIDGE, which is Bayes-optimal under this exact
prior (posterior mean = min-norm least squares), so it is a floor and not a competitor.

| k in context | 0 | 1 | 2 | 4 | 7 | 8 | 10 | 19 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| transformer (in-context) | 1.004 | 0.879 | 0.742 | 0.502 | 0.226 | 0.192 | 0.116 | 0.046 |
| ridge = Bayes-optimal | 1.003 | 0.874 | 0.734 | 0.485 | 0.126 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 |
| predict-zero | 1.003 | 0.996 | 0.935 | 0.942 | 0.945 | 0.957 | 1.034 | 0.938 |

1. **The control passes trivially:** MEMORISE reaches 0.000 at every k, so the optimiser and schedule are sound and nothing
   below is an artefact of a broken training loop.
2. **In-context regression is genuinely learned**, and it is close to OPTIMAL while the problem is statistical: at k=1,2,4
   the transformer is within 0.005–0.02 of the Bayes floor. It is not approximating regression loosely; it is nearly
   saturating the information in the prompt.
3. **The gap opens exactly where the problem stops being statistical.** At k ≥ d=8 the system is determined and ridge is
   EXACT (0.000) while the transformer only decays toward it (0.046 at k=19). It behaves like a good estimator, not like a
   linear solver — which is the interesting part, and the obvious thing to push on next.
4. **THE SCHEDULE IS NOT LOAD-BEARING.** Cosine-with-warmup vs constant LR, three seeds: constant won two of three and the
   differences sit inside seed noise (e.g. k=10: cosine 0.116/0.120/0.118 against constant 0.137/0.087/0.087). The honest
   reading of the original question is that AdamW learns this with or without a schedule at this scale. A single seed would
   have "shown" cosine winning — the first run did.

**Obvious next probes** (cheap, same script): does the k ≥ d gap close with more steps/width, or is it structural? does it
survive label noise (where ridge with the right λ is optimal and OLS is not)? does it extrapolate to k beyond the training
length, and to a d it was never trained on?
