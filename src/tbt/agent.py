"""agent.py — the live entry point of the TBT agent, and the ROOT of the reachability graph (RULES.md #2).

FIRST VERTICAL SLICE (2026-07-10): the agent composes TWO cortical columns — a SENSORY column and a TASK column
(ARCHITECTURE §5.1: always multi-column) — and runs a sensorimotor SCAN in which the task column carries a factored STATE
between fixations that conditions the sensory column's next-content prediction (project_place_invariance_needs_factored_state).
This is `option2.py`'s validated place-invariance mechanism, now built as the real column composition and wired from here
(so `column` → `htm`/`encoders` are all reachable — the reachability test flips to fully-wired). It is deliberately thin
(RULES.md #4/#5, feedback_thin_shell_agent): the columns do the work; the agent only routes fixations + carries state + reads
out. Task-format code (encoding a number into per-place feature SDRs, the train/test split) lives in the TEST, not here.

NEXT: thicken toward the full loop — the deep layers (L5 motor / L6 location) + the hippocampal rollout + BG select +
thalamus gate come as tasks exercise them (STATUS.md 'Next'). The generic game interface `step(observation)` is still a stub.
