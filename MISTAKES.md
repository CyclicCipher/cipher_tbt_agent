# Mistakes File

## Purpose & Usage Instructions

This file catalogues all mistakes made during development - both code bugs and architectural/theoretical errors. **ALWAYS** consult this file before:
- Writing new code
- Designing architectures
- Solving problems
- Making design decisions

**When adding mistakes:**
- Check for duplicates first
- Include: what was wrong, why it failed, what the correct approach is
- Link to specific commits/files if applicable
- Update attempted fixes as we learn more

## Architectural & Theoretical Mistakes

### 1. Convolutional Neural Networks with Predictive Coding
**What we tried:** Building a CNN trained with predictive coding
**Why it failed:** Repeatedly failed implementation despite multiple correction attempts. CNN architectures may have fundamental incompatibilities with our PC implementation approach.
**Correct approach:** Use standard predictive coding network architectures as documented in literature, not custom CNN hybrids. Reference VERSES (Karl Friston's company) for scaling solutions.
**Status:** Abandoned - use standard PC approaches

### 2. Custom Two-Compartment Neuron Design
**What we tried:** Custom neuron architecture with separate error and representation compartments
**Why it failed:** Overcomplicated and non-standard. Not aligned with proven predictive coding implementations.
**Correct approach:** Use whatever standard predictive coding neural networks use in literature (VERSES, Millidge et al., Whittington & Bogacz)
**Status:** Needs replacement with standard PC neurons

### 3. Output Clamping for Pretraining
**What we tried:** Clamping network outputs to target labels during pretraining (e.g., forcing output to "5" for MNIST digit 5)
**Why it failed:** Forces convergence without building the pathways that would allow the network to converge on the right answer naturally. Prevents proper feature learning and representation building.
**Correct approach:** Allow network to build proper internal representations through prediction error minimization. Don't force outputs - let the network learn the mappings.
**Status:** Critical - never use output clamping

### 4. Error Signal Propagation with Exponential Precision Scaling
**What we tried:** Increasing precision by 10x at each layer to combat error signal fade in deep networks (5-7+ layers)
**Why it failed:** Fundamentally wrong approach. Creates numerical instability and doesn't address root cause of vanishing gradients in predictive coding.
**Correct approach:** Research VERSES solutions for scaling predictive coding beyond 5-7 layers. Likely involves architectural changes, not parameter hacks.
**Status:** Never attempt exponential precision scaling again

## Process & Workflow Mistakes

### 5. Not Learning from Repeated Mistakes
**What happened:** Made the same errors multiple times without maintaining a record
**Why it failed:** No systematic way to track and prevent repeat errors
**Solution:** This mistakes file. Always consult before making decisions.
**Status:** Implemented (this file)

### 6. Context Compression Loss
**What happened:** Lost critical research context mid-task due to conversation compression
**Why it failed:** No long-term memory system for preserving important design decisions, constraints, and research findings
**Solution needed:** Implement a long-term memory system (design docs, architectural decision records, research notes that persist)
**Status:** Needs implementation - propose solution
